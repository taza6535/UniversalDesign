        <h2>Tabula Rasa</h2>
        <p id="p1" style="font-size: 16px;">
            My favorite project from any class is the one I am working on currently for my senior capstone class.
            I am in the Entrepreneurial Projects capstone class where you work with a team to come up with a product idea and work the entire year to create the business plan and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) by the end of the year. 
            I am working a team of 4 other people to build a platform where users can enter a financial goal and the app will create a roadmap for them to reach that goal while also educating them along the way for any financial concepts they might not have knowledge about.

        <h2>The Progress So Far</h2>
        <h3>Lean Canvas</h3>
        <p id="p2" style="font-size: 16px;">
            We began the semester with the ideation phase and creating a Lean Canvas. 
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="img/tabulaleancanvas.png" alt="a lean canvas showing information about the idea" style="height: 400px; width: 700px">
            <figcaption>Lean Canvas</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            A Lean Canvas is a document that gives a brief overview of the product. It displays the problem, solution, key metrics, unique value proposition, unfair advantage, distribution channels, customer segments, revenue structure, and cost structure.
            We worked to fill out this document throughout the semester to get a good sense of the overview of our idea. 
        </p>
        <h3>Empathy Interviews</h3>
        <p>
            We also conducted empathy interviews with our target audience to get a better sense of their expereinces and issues with the current solutions out there. 
            This was a very important step of the process since it really helped us shape what the final product would look like. 
            As a team, we wanted our product to be something that our target audience wanted and needed so these interviews were critical.
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="img/empathyinterviews.png" alt="a spreadhsheet showing some of the data we collected" style="height: 400px; width: 700px">
            <figcaption>Empathy Interview Data</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            We collected all of the interview data in a spreadsheet (shown above) so that we could efficiently analyze the answers.
        </p>
        <h3>Figma Prototype of MVP</h3>
        <p>
            After completing the empathy interviews, we got to work on creating a prototype of what our app would look like in Figma. 
            We tried to have the most key features of our app to give a good idea of what we offer. 
        </p>
        <figure style="text-align: center;">
            <img src="img/figma.png" alt="a screen on an phone showing the page where you would see your goals" style="height: 400px; width: 200px">
            <figcaption>One screen from our Figma protoype</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
            Now that we have a good representation of what our app looks like, we will start developing it in the new year. 
            The tech stack we have chosen to implement this project is React Native for the front-end, Python Django for the back-end, and SQLite for the database.
            As we develop the app, we will also be preparing to participate in New Venture Challenge (NVC) where different startups come to pitch their idea for a chance to win money.

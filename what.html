        <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
        <p id="p1" style="font-size: 16px;">
            Universal Design (UD) is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability. 
            An environment (or any building, product, or service in that environment) should be designed to meet the needs of all people who wish to use it. 
            This is not a special requirement, for the benefit of only a minority of the population. 
            It is a fundamental condition of good design.
        </p>
        <p>
            If an environment is accessible, usable, convenient and a pleasure to use, everyone benefits. 
            By considering the diverse needs and abilities of all throughout the design process, universal design creates digital and built environments, services and systems that meet peoples' needs. 
            Simply put, universal design is good design.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will specfically be discussing Universal Design in the context of the internet.

            <h2>Norman's Design Concepts</h2>
            <p>
                Norman's design concepts from Don Norman, a notable figure in the field of human-computer interaction.
                Norman details six different key design principles to keep in mind while designing any product or interface. 
                They ensure that the product being designed will be intuitive and easy to use.
            </p>
            <h3>1. Visibility</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/login.png" alt="a login modal with text fields for email and password" style="width: 300px; height: 400px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;">LinkedIn's Login Modal</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The concept of visibility is that a user should be able to see what they can do and their options.
                For example, the above image shows LinkedIn's login screen.
                Once a user enters this interface, they are only given the optons to login. 
                The only informaton needed to log-in is the user's email or phone number and their password. 
                If there was any other information present, it would violate the cooncept of visibility and would clutter the interface.
            </p>
            <h3>2. Feedback</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/feedback.png" alt="a bank transaction page showing a successful transaction" style="width: 300px; height: 500px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;">A successful bank transaction</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Feedback refers to what the user sees after every action they do. 
                The user should get some sort of feedback that tells them whether their action was successful or not. 
                The image above shows a screen from a bank app where a user makes a transaction and the combination of the words "Transction"
                "complete" and the green checkmark show the user that their transaction was successful.
            </p>
            <h3>3. Affordance</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/affordance.png" alt="various buttons that say submit" style="width: auto; height: 100px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;">Various buttons that say submit</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Affordance is the link beteween what an object looks like and its use. 
                A user should know what to do when they see something. 
                This factor speaks to the intuitiveness of a product. 
                In the example above, there are three buttons that say the word submit. 
                When the submit is on a visible button (like the one on the right), the user knows that if they press it it will submit the information they have entered.

            </p>
            <h3>4. Mapping</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/scrollbar.png" alt="a vertical scroll bar" style="width: auto; height: 200px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;">A vertical scroll bar</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Mapping refers to the idea that the control for something will closely resemble its effect. 
                In the real world this can be seen in a stovetop where the placement of the knobs usually relates to where the burner is. 
                On the internet, as seen in the image above, sites usually have a scrollbar if there is a lot of information. 
                The position of the scrollbar lets the user know where they are in the page. 
                Dragging the bar in a certain direction will also cause the page to move in the same direction. 
            </p>
            <h3>5. Constraints</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/constraint.png" alt="a log in modal with the submit button grayed out" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
                <figcaption style="text-align: center;">A login modal</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                Constraints help to restrict what the user can do. 
                Sometimes, you don't want the user to do something if the right conditions are not met. 
                For example, the developer might not want the user to be able to submit their login information if they have not filled out the information. 
                This can also work if the user has not filled out or formatted their information properly. 
                The above image shows th submit button is grayed out until the email and password fields are filled out properly. 
            </p>
            <h3>6. Consistency</h3>
            <figure style="text-align: center;">
                <img src="img/consistency.png" alt="depicting inconsistent and constent fonts" style="width: auto; height: 400px;">
            </figure>
            <p>
                Consistency ensures that the user will known what to do as they further navigate your site. 
                For example, all buttons should look the same and all text should be similar. 
                As shown in the image above, all the fonts your site uses should be the same for one structural element. 
                This means, all headings should have the same font as shown. 
                If the fonts are all different, then the user might get confused as to what they need to click to reach their desired destination.
